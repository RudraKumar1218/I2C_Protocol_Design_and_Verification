# I2C Protocol Design and Verification

## Overview
This project implements an I2C master controller in Verilog, featuring an FSM-based design for managing start/stop conditions, address transmission, and data transfer. It supports 7-bit slave addressing, dynamic read/write operations, acknowledgment detection, and clock synchronization (SCL).

## Features
- FSM-based I2C master controller
- Supports dynamic read/write operations
- 7-bit slave addressing
- Acknowledgment detection and clock synchronization
